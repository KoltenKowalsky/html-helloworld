    <h4>Kolten's Deliverables</h4>
    <p>Every enterprise environment is unique.  Technical systems are highly individualized by business needs.  Having
        documentation of any type is essential to support planning and executing changes.  “Good documentation” makes 
        the difference of high performing outputs compared to mediocracy.</p>     
    

        <p>Kolten has authored hundreds of custom documents tailored to situational needs including plans, models, 
        diagrams, solution visualizations, process flows, and other templates including written explanations, in short and 
        long narratives.  He creates new artifacts and modifies existing based on various methodologies in new product 
        development, enterprise architecture, project management (agile/waterfall) and others.  Kolten has led many agile 
        digital programs and projects working with teams to scan the enterprise, horizontally and vertically, evaluating 
        internal and external process experiences, as shown listed below in figure 1.    </p>

        <h3>Technical Aggregator</h3>
        <p>He produces variations of content based on audience, messaging, policies, and media formats such as PowerPoint, 
            Word, Excel, Visio, intranet pages, and repositories within system tools, both automated and user generated (living
            real-time).  Each type of dataset could be used individually or collectively to best provide “storytelling” for certain 
            pieces, parts, or the entire program solution, such as a playbook or collection of artifacts in compliance with 
            TOGAF, SAFe, PMO and other governance guidelines.  </p>
            
            <p>Kolten uses artifacts, as storytelling techniques, to run successful meetings, team build, solution develop and justify
            options.  He mentors managers, architects, leads, analysts, and developers sharing best practices. 
            He prepares methodical data investigations collecting inputs from organizational domains.
            He advocates “follow the data” research method.   
            
            <p class="bold">His super strength is to arrange unstructured data into dataset functions, showing direct and 
            indirect dependencies across business processes and IT system stacks. </p>   
            
            <p> The last step is fitting all the puzzle pieces 
            into a presentation spelling out what it means, drawing upon written and visual cues to depict key messaging, tying 
            together facts, figures, and topics.  One of the biggest advantages of having good visual references incorporated into written and verbal explanations is
            navigating complex and technical conversations with diverse resources.  
            Walk-me-through plans and keeping discussions on point can be better accomplished! </p>
            
            <p class="bold">As a result, audiences (stakeholders, leads and functional 
            resources) gain faster orientation, clarification, and next steps direction. </p> 
        <br>
        <br>    
        <p>Kolten has created and published thought leadership on many enterprise change management topics, see
